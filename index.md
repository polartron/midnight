It all started with a Counter Strike 1.6 server in 2005. From there until now I've modded, mapped, scripted, tinkered, programmed and released some games. Here are some things I've made.

</h2>

```
Company: Spillkaminen
Length: 2020-2022
Role: Owner
```
Open Netcode is a server authoritative networking package for Unity DOTS. It contains most of the knowledge I've learned over the years from studying Source Engine, Overwatch, Rocket League and countless articles and videos on the subject. It is the core package for best-practice multiplayer games made by Spillkaminen.

Company: Krillbite Studio
Length: 2016-2018
Role: Programmer & Lead Programmer
```
Mosaic is a weird dystopian story game about not wanting to go to work. I took over the role as Lead Programmer in 2017 and made several core additions to the codebase as well as managing multiple team members and planning.

```
Company: Krillbite Studio
Length: 2015-2016
Role: Programmer
```
Among the Sleep is a horror game where you play as a two year old child and your mother is missing. I was hired in the beginning of 2015 to do console porting to the Playstation 4 and Xbox One. A great undertaking considering the engine had to be upgraded from Unity 4 to Unity 5. I later did some initial work on the Nintendo Switch port and the enhanced edition of the game.

![Size DOES Matter](/assets/images/sizedoesmatter.png)
```
Company: DOS Studios
Length: 2013-2015
Role: Programmer & CEO
```
Size DOES Matter is a mobile game about rhythmically fitting inside different sized holes. We won a BAFTA for this one, got published by Channel 4 and had a month of free TV ads on UK television.

  Main Skills
  </p>
</h2>

<h2>
C#
</h2>
My main language of choice and the one I'm the most proficient in. I've gone through all the different stages of writing bad code, to knowing a lot of *coding principles* and overengineering my code, to landing on a more data oriented approach with procedural programming techniques. My current method of writing code in C# is to focus on the data transformation aspect of it and using object oriented programming as a support structure and a facade to keep the code flat, pragmatic and easy to use.

<h2>
C/C++
</h2>
I haven't touched this in a couple of years but for the first 6 years this was the main language I did projects with. I used a bunch of libraries like boost, SFML, Box2D, glew, json-spirit and learned how absolutely awful it was to deal with project dependencies. It was the language that taught me about memory usage, stack vs heap and how pointers work. My biggest project in this language was a game made in school using an

and SFML.

<h2>
Networking in Games
</h2>
I have in depth knowledge of how the network stack works down to how diffent types of packet headers are structured. I can tell you how TCP differs from UDP and why UDP is required for high frequency multiplayer games. I've used tools like Wireshark, wpe-pro and XVI32 to reverse engineer the network protocol in the early days of Minecraft to make sponge spawning spambots back when creative mode was a thing. I've used jittering, congestion and lag-switching to gain an unfair advantage (for research purposes) in games like Planetside 2, Darkfall Online and other games that use *Clientside Authority* and/or *State Synchronization*. I know and have implemented techniques like delta compression and clientside prediction. This is my main area of interest and I will keep expanding my knowledge by studying how great multiplayer games are made.

Teaching. I taught two college semesters of **Introduction to C# in Unity**. I can do workshops too.
Presenting. Over the years I've done numerous talks on different topics including project scoping and idea development.
