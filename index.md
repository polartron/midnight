In 2005 I hosted a custom Counter Strike 1.6 server. Since then I've modded, mapped, scripted, tinkered, programmed and released some games.

I have 6+ years of game studio experience, multiple released projects and a broad range of programming knowledge.
My current interest is the making of multiplayer games and netcode for multiplayer games.

Here's a list of companies and projects I've worked on.

| Year  | Company | Projects |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 2013-2015  | DOS Studios | Size DOES Matter, Cube Cube |
| 2015-2018  | Krillbite Studio | Among the Sleep for PS4 & Xbox One, Mosaic |
| 2018  | Improbable | SpatialOS Unity GDK Prototyping |
| 2018  | Agens | Skate City |
| 2019  | Hyper Games | Mosaic for iOS |
| 2019-2020  | Snow Software  | Software Asset Management plugins |
| 2020-now  | Spillkaminen | Open Netcode, Bear Survival, Rock Paper Scissors Royale |
| 2022 | Black Book Games | Prototyping and High Concept Design |

Open Netcode is an open source server authoritative networking package for Unity DOTS. I thought Unity's Netcode package was too complicated so I made my own in my own way. It is the main networking package I use for multiplayer games.

Among the Sleep is a horror game where you play as a two year old child and your mother is missing. I was hired in the beginning of 2015 to do console porting to the Playstation 4 and Xbox One as well as upgrading the project from Unity 4 to Unity 5. I later did some initial work on the Nintendo Switch port and the enhanced edition of the game.

  Main Skills
  </p>
</h2>
<h2>
C#
</h2>
My main language of choice and the one I'm the most proficient in. I've gone through all the different stages of writing bad code, to knowing a lot of *coding principles* and overengineering my code, to finally landing on a more data oriented approach with procedural programming techniques. My current method of writing code in C# is to focus on the data transformation aspect of it and using object oriented programming as a support structure and a facade in order to keep the code flat, pragmatic and easy to use.

<h2>
C/C++
</h2>
I haven't touched this in a couple of years but for the first 6 years this was the main language I did projects with. I used a bunch of libraries like boost, SFML, Box2D, glew, json-spirit and luabind. It was the language that taught me about memory usage, stack vs heap and how pointers work. My biggest project in this language was a game made in school using an 
<a href="https://github.com/ptrefall/propcomp">Entity Component Library by PÃ¥l Trefall</a>
, SFML and Box2D.

<h2>
Networking in Games
</h2>
I'm very interested in how games implement their netcode so I know a lot about it. I know how to do low level implementations of methods like delta snapshots, prediction and lag compensation and how to boost performance of them using multithreading.

  Other Skills
  </p>
</h2>
Here are some other less important skills I have
<br/>

<h3>
Unit Testing
</h3> 
I like to write Unit Tests where it makes sense to write them. Procedural Programming is by default very open to unit testing, but sometimes an integration test (or just watching the thing work) is enough. Pragmatic where it makes sense. Don't overdo it, but don't be fully exposed to regression either.

<h3>
Lua
</h3>
I've made a bunch of experimental scripts and gamemodes in Garry's Mod since 2006 and used Luabind for C++ in college.

<h3>
Python
</h3>
I can write and modify simple scripts. In 2015 I used this to make a Raspberry PI powered robot on wheels and in 2019 I messed around with tensorflow for machine learning. 

<h3>
Javascript
</h3>
I've made some scripts with Tampermonkey and Node. In 2014 I made an arbitrage trading bot for a Dota 2 trading website and in 2020 I made a crypto arbitrage trading bot for an exchange without a trading API. When I worked on Mosaic I made a simple web server using express in node to collect editor logs, screenshots and performance logs from Unity.

<h3>
Shaders
</h3>
I've written a few shaders. Most of them are technical shaders like using double buffering for water and melting snow, metaballs, or instancing of objects using compute buffers. I'm not so good at making things look pretty but I'm not calling myself an artist. 

<h3>
Databases
</h3>
In high school and college I learned MySQL and how to write queries with PHP. I've used SQLite for some projects.

<h3>
Encryption
</h3>
I wrote an RSA encrypted login server in college. Today I slap OpenSSL on top of projects or use a third party authentication service like OAuth. 

<h3>
Teaching
</h3>
I've taught two college semesters of **Introduction to C# in Unity**. I've done workshops too.

<h3>
Source Control
</h3>
I know git. I managed a Synology NAS with GitLab for Krillbite and I've used git for most of my projects.

<h3>
Project Planning
</h3>
I know how to use project planning tools and techniques but I use post-it notes for my own projects.

</div>
```
Name: Rainbow
Company: Krillbite
Status: Prototype
When: 2017
```
A SpatialOS game made in under a week for a norwegian game jam. It was later used in promotional videos by Improbable to promote their Unity SDK.

![Gas Simulation](/assets/images/gas.png)
<div style="text-align: center">
  <a href="https://github.com/polartron/gas-flow" target="_blank">Github</a>
</div>
```
Name: Gas Simulation
Status: Prototype
When: 2021
```
Inspired by how atmospherics was simulated in Space Station 13 I decided to make my own and try to push the limits on how performant I can make it using Burst Compiled Jobs in Unity. I read up on the Ideal Gas Law, Adiabatic Compression and implemented them as a multithreaded, double buffered atmospheric simulation in Unity.

Name: Flow Field Pathfinding
Status: Prototype
When: 2019
```
I didn't know how flow fields worked so I read up on it and made an asset that converted an Unity Navmesh into a flow field with simple flocking behaviour for agents.

```
Name: Floggy
Status: Released on Google Play. Decayed and got removed.
When: 2015
