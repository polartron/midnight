It all started with a Counter Strike 1.6 server in 2005. From there until now I've modded, mapped, scripted, tinkered, programmed and released some games. Here are some things I've made.

Open Netcode is a server authoritative networking package for Unity DOTS. It contains most of the knowledge I've learned over the years from studying Source Engine, Overwatch, Rocket League and countless articles and videos on the subject. It is the core package for best-practice multiplayer games made by Spillkaminen.

Mosaic is a weird dystopian story game about not wanting to go to work. I took over the role as Lead Programmer in 2017 and made several core additions to the codebase as well as managing multiple team members and planning.

Among the Sleep is a horror game where you play as a two year old child and your mother is missing. I was hired in the beginning of 2015 to do console porting to the Playstation 4 and Xbox One. A great undertaking considering the engine had to be upgraded from Unity 4 to Unity 5. I later did some initial work on the Nintendo Switch port and the enhanced edition of the game.

A game about rhythmically fitting inside different sized holes. We won a BAFTA for this one, got published by Channel 4 and had a month of free TV ads on
