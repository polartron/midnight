It all started with a Counter Strike 1.6 server in 2005. From there until now I've modded, mapped, scripted, tinkered, programmed and released some games. Here are some things I've made.

Open Netcode is a server authoritative networking package for Unity DOTS. It contains most of the knowledge I've learned over the years from studying Source Engine, Overwatch, Rocket League and countless articles and videos on the subject. It is the core package for best-practice multiplayer games made by Spillkaminen.

Role: Programmer
```
Among the Sleep is a horror game where you play as a two year old child and your mother is missing. I was hired in the beginning of 2015 to do console porting to the Playstation 4 and Xbox One. A great undertaking considering the engine had to be upgraded from Unity 4 to Unity 5. I later did some initial work on the Nintendo Switch port and the enhanced edition of the game.

Size DOES Matter is a mobile game about rhythmically fitting inside different sized holes. We won a BAFTA for this one, got published by Channel 4 and had a month of free TV ads on UK television.

C#
</h2>
My main language of choice and the one I'm the most proficient in. I've gone through all the different stages of writing bad code, to knowing a lot of *coding principles* and overengineering my code, to landing on a more data oriented approach with procedural programming techniques. My current method of writing code in C# is to focus on the data transformation aspect of it and using object oriented programming as a support structure and a facade to keep the code flat, pragmatic and easy to use.

C/C++
</h2>
I haven't touched this in a couple of years but for the first 6 years this was the main language I did projects with. I used a bunch of libraries like boost, SFML, Box2D, glew, json-spirit and learned how absolutely awful it was to deal with project dependencies. It was the language that taught me about memory usage, stack vs heap and how pointers work. My biggest project in this language was a game made in school using an

and SFML.

Teaching. I taught two college semesters of **Introduction to C# in Unity**. I can do workshops too.
Presenting. Over the years I've done numerous talks on different topics including project scoping and idea development.
