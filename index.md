It all started with a Counter Strike 1.6 server in 2005. From there until now I've modded, mapped, scripted, tinkered, programmed and released some games. Here are some things I've worked on.

```
Name: Open Netcode
Status: Work in progress
Company: Spillkaminen
When: 2020-2022
Role: Owner
```
Open Netcode is a server authoritative networking package for Unity DOTS. It contains most of the knowledge I've learned over the years from studying Source Engine, Overwatch, Rocket League and countless articles and videos on the subject. It is the core package for best-practice multiplayer games made by Spillkaminen.

  Main Skills
  </p>
</h2>

<h2>
C#
</h2>
My main language of choice and the one I'm the most proficient in. I've gone through all the different stages of writing bad code, to knowing a lot of *coding principles* and overengineering my code, to finally landing on a more data oriented approach with procedural programming techniques. My current method of writing code in C# is to focus on the data transformation aspect of it and using object oriented programming as a support structure and a facade in order to keep the code flat, pragmatic and easy to use.

<h2>
C/C++
</h2>
I haven't touched this in a couple of years but for the first 6 years this was the main language I did projects with. I used a bunch of libraries like boost, SFML, Box2D, glew, json-spirit and learned how absolutely awful it was to deal with project dependencies. It was the language that taught me about memory usage, stack vs heap and how pointers work. My biggest project in this language was a game made in school using an 
<a href="https://github.com/ptrefall/propcomp">Entity Component Library by PÃ¥l Trefall</a>
, SFML and Box2D.

<h2>
Networking in Games
</h2>
I have in depth knowledge on how the networking stack works down to how diffent types of packet headers are structured. I can tell you how TCP differs from UDP and why UDP should be used for high frequency multiplayer games. I've used tools like Wireshark, wpe-pro and XVI32 to reverse engineer the network protocol in the early days of Minecraft to make sponge spawning spambots back when creative mode was a thing. I've used jittering, congestion and lag-switching to gain an unfair advantage (for research purposes) in games like Planetside 2, Darkfall Online and other games that use *Clientside Authority* and/or *Tickless Simulation*. I know and have implemented techniques like delta compression and clientside prediction in Unity and I will keep expanding my knowledge by studying how great netcode is written and how bad netcode can be exploited (again, for research purposes).

  Other Skills
  </p>
</h2>
Here are some other less important skills I have
<br/>

<h3>
Unit Testing
</h3> 
I like to write Unit Tests where it makes sense to write them. Procedural Programming is by default very open to unit testing, but sometimes an integration test (or just watching the thing work) is enough. Pragmatic where it makes sense. Don't overdo it, but don't be fully exposed to regression either.

<h3>
Computer Science
</h3>
I know how computers work. I know how the CPU accesses memory and how to reduce cache misses in the L1 cache. I know basic assembly code and some of the optimizations you can do in order to produce highly efficent machine code. I've built a rack server back in 2010 for Counter Strike 1.6 and Garry's Mod which eventually turned into a bitcoin miner.

<h3>
Lua
</h3>
I've made a bunch of experimental scripts and gamemodes in Garry's Mod since 2006 and used Luabind for C++ in college.

<h3>
Python
</h3>
I can write and modify simple scripts. In 2015 I used this to make a Raspberry PI powered robot on wheels and in 2019 I messed around with tensorflow for machine learning. 

<h3>
Javascript
</h3>
I've made some scripts with Tampermonkey and Node. In 2014 I made an arbitrage trading bot for a Dota 2 trading website and in 2020 I made a crypto arbitrage trading bot for an exchange without a trading API. When I worked on Mosaic I made a simple web server using express in node to collect editor logs, screenshots and performance logs from Unity.

<h3>
Shaders
</h3>
I've written a few shaders. Most of them are technical shaders like using double buffering for water and melting snow, metaballs, or instancing of objects using compute buffers. I'm not so good at making things look pretty but I'm not calling myself an artist. 

<h3>
Databases
</h3>
In high school and college I learned how MySQL works and how to write queries with PHP. I've used SQLite for some projects and I know how how to do simple things in phpmyadmin.

<h3>
Encryption
</h3>
I wrote an RSA encrypted login server in college and went really deep into learning the mathematics of it. Today I slap OpenSSL on top of projects or use a third party authentication service like OAuth. 

<h3>
Teaching
</h3>
I've taught two college semesters of **Introduction to C# in Unity**. I've done workshops too.

<h3>
Presenting
</h3> 
Over the years I've done numerous talks on different topics including project scoping, idea development and data oriented programming.

<h3>
Source Control
</h3>
I know git. I managed a Synology NAS with GitLab for Krillbite and I've used git for most of my projects. I know about the other source control tools like Perforce, SVN, Plastic SCM and how they work but I haven't used them for big projects.

<h3>
Project Planning
</h3>
I know how to use project planning tools in teams but I use post-it notes for my own projects. I probably know how to use the planning tools you're using, maybe even intuitively, because I've been through a lot of them. Jira is the biggest one. In realty most of project planning features gets in the way of actual development so I try to be  pragmatic about it and only use features that doesn't get in the way. In most cases that is just a task list. Github Issues is great.

Less important projects I've worked on.

![Rainbow](/assets/images/rainbow.png)
```
Name: Rainbow
Company: Krillbite
Status: Prototype
When: 2017
```
A SpatialOS game made in under a week for a norwegian game jam. It was later used in promotional videos by Improbable to promote their Unity SDK. 

<hr>
![Gas Simulation](/assets/images/gas.png)
```
Name: Gas Simulation
Status: Prototype
When: 2021
```
Inspired by how atmospherics was simulated in Space Station 13 I decided to make my own and try to push the limits on how performant I can make it using Burst Compiled Jobs in Unity. I read up on the Ideal Gas Law, Adiabatic Compression and implemented them as a multithreaded, double buffered atmospheric simulation in Unity. 

<hr> 
![Flow Fields](/assets/images/flowfields.png)
```
Name: Flow Field Pathfinding
Status: Prototype
When: 2019
```
I didn't know how flow fields worked so I read up on it and made an asset that converted an Unity Navmesh into a flow field with simple flocking behaviour for agents.

<hr> 
![Floggy](/assets/images/floggy.png)
```
Name: Floggy
Status: Released on Google Play. Decayed and got removed.
When: 2015
```
Floggy was originally an one hour game jam project that turned into two days when we realized how fun it was. You control a sausage-creature in a downwards adventure to escape the squares chasing you from above. Get as far as possible. I wrote most of the code and made sounds by slapping wet toilet paper.
