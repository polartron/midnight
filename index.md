It all started with a Counter Strike 1.6 server in 2005. From there until now I've modded, mapped, scripted, tinkered, programmed and released some games. Here are some things I've made.

</h2>

![Open Netcode](/assets/images/netcode.png)
```
Company: Spillkaminen
Length: 2020-2022
Role: Owner
```
Open Netcode is a server authoritative networking package for Unity DOTS. It contains most of the knowledge I've learned over the years from studying Source Engine, Overwatch, Rocket League and countless articles and videos on the subject. It is the core package for best-practice multiplayer games made by Spillkaminen.

![Mosaic](/assets/images/mosaic.png)
```
Company: Krillbite Studio
Length: 2016-2018
Role: Programmer & Lead Programmer
```
Mosaic is a weird dystopian story game about not wanting to go to work. I took over the role as Lead Programmer in 2017 and made several core additions to the codebase as well as managing multiple team members and planning.

```
Company: Krillbite Studio
Length: 2015-2016
Role: Programmer
```
Among the Sleep is a horror game where you play as a two year old child and your mother is missing. I was hired in the beginning of 2015 to do console porting to the Playstation 4 and Xbox One. A great undertaking considering the engine had to be upgraded from Unity 4 to Unity 5. I later did some initial work on the Nintendo Switch port and the enhanced edition of the game.

![Size DOES Matter](/assets/images/sizedoesmatter.png)
```
Company: DOS Studios
Length: 2013-2015
Role: Programmer & CEO
```
Size DOES Matter is a mobile game about rhythmically fitting inside different sized holes. We won a BAFTA for this one, got published by Channel 4 and had a month of free ads on UK television.

  Main Skills
  </p>
</h2>

<h2>
C#
</h2>
My main language of choice and the one I'm the most proficient in. I've gone through all the different stages of writing bad code, to knowing a lot of *coding principles* and overengineering my code, to landing on a more data oriented approach with procedural programming techniques. My current method of writing code in C# is to focus on the data transformation aspect of it and using object oriented programming as a support structure and a facade in order to keep the code flat, pragmatic and easy to use.

<h2>
C/C++
</h2>
I haven't touched this in a couple of years but for the first 6 years this was the main language I did projects with. I used a bunch of libraries like boost, SFML, Box2D, glew, json-spirit and learned how absolutely awful it was to deal with project dependencies. It was the language that taught me about memory usage, stack vs heap and how pointers work. My biggest project in this language was a game made in school using an 
<a href="https://github.com/ptrefall/propcomp">Entity Component Library by PÃ¥l Trefall</a>
, SFML and Box2D.

<h2>
Networking in Games
</h2>
I have in depth knowledge on how the networking stack works down to how diffent types of packet headers are structured. I can tell you how TCP differs from UDP and why UDP should be used for high frequency multiplayer games. I've used tools like Wireshark, wpe-pro and XVI32 to reverse engineer the network protocol in the early days of Minecraft to make sponge spawning spambots back when creative mode was a thing. I've used jittering, congestion and lag-switching to gain an unfair advantage (for research purposes) in games like Planetside 2, Darkfall Online and other games that use *Clientside Authority* and/or *State Synchronization*. I know and have implemented techniques like delta compression and clientside prediction. I will keep expanding my knowledge by studying how great netcode is written and how bad netcode can be exploited (again, for research purposes).

Here's some other things than I know how to do.
<br/>

<h3>
Unit Testing
</h3> 
I like to write Unit Tests where it makes sense to write them. Procedural Programming is by default very open to unit testing, but sometimes an integration test (or just watching the thing work) is enough. Pragmatic where it makes sense. Don't overdo it, but don't be fully exposed to regression either.

<h3>
Computer Science
</h3>
I know how computers work. I know how the CPU accesses memory and how to reduce cache misses in the L1 cache. I know basic assembly code and some of the optimizations you can do in order to produce highly efficent machine code. I've built a rack server back in 2010 for Counter Strike 1.6 which eventually turned into a bitcoin miner.

<h3>
Lua
</h3>
I've made some things in Garry's Mod since 2006 and used Luabind for C++ in college.

<h3>
Python
</h3>
I can write and modify simple scripts. In 2015 I used this to make a Raspberry PI powered robot on wheels and in 2019 I messed around with tensorflow for machine learning. 

<h3>
Javascript
</h3>
I've made some scripts with Tampermonkey and Node. In 2014 I made an arbitrage trading bot for a Dota 2 trading website and in 2020 I made a crypto arbitrage trading bot for an exchange without a trading API. When I worked in Krillbite I made a simple web server using express in node to collect editor, screenshots and performance logs when working on Mosaic.

<h3>
Shaders
</h3>
I've written a few shaders. Most of them are technical shaders like using double buffering for water and melting snow, metaballs, or instancing of objects using compute buffers. I'm not so good at making things look pretty but I'm not calling myself an artist. 

<h3>
Teaching
</h3>
I've taught two college semesters of **Introduction to C# in Unity**. I've done workshops too.

<h3>
Presenting
</h3> 
Over the years I've done numerous talks on different topics including project scoping, idea development and data oriented programming.

<h3>
Source Control
</h3>
I know git. I managed a Synology NAS with GitLab for Krillbite and I've used git for most of my projects. I know about the other source control tools like Perforce, SVN, Plastic SCM and how they work but I haven't used them for big projects.

<h3>
Project Planning
</h3>
I know how to use project planning tools in teams but I use post-it notes for my own projects. Whatever type of project planning tools you use I probably know how to use them, maybe even intuitively, because I've been through a lot of them. Jira is the biggest one. In realty most of project planning tools gets in the way of actual development and progress so I try to be extremely pragmatic about it and only use what helps development. In most cases that is just a task list. Github Issues is great.
